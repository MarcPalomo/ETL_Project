Thank you for looking at Maralee Capella and Marc Palomo's ETL Project. This Read Me file contains all the file names found
in this project:

ETL_Project.sql
This file shows the creation of the Database and Tables. It also contains the code that alters the tables
to add a our primary keys and displaying some helpful summary information and joins.

ETL_Project_Code.ipynb
This file is the code from jupyter notebook that takes us through the data extract, transforming, and loading. This file was
cleaned to show the most essential steps in our process.

Malaria_Deaths.csv
Medical_Doctors.csv
Both these files show all our original datasets taken from the website.

Finally the last document is ETL Project -- Palomo_Capella.pdf which contains the report write-up.
